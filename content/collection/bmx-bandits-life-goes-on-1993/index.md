BMX Bandits - Life Goes On
Creation Records – CRELP 133 / 1993 / UK

Bellshill's BMX Bandits released their first Creation album in 1993, and what a marvellous label debut it was!

It includes the classic "Serious Drugs", A wonderful song with a nod to George Harrison. It was co-written with Norman Blake from Teenage Fanclub, who also plays guitar and provides vocals in other songs on the album.

The rest of the album is packed with great moments. Yes, you could argue that there's a certain similarity between the songs, but I don't feel that I'm listening to the same song with just a slight variation over and over again. "I'll Keep on Joking", "Cast a Shadow", and "It Hasn't Ended" are top highlights.

"Kylie's Got a Crush on Us" was released as a single, however, I feel that any of the other tunes I've mentioned are far stronger.

If you like Teenage Fanclub, but have never listened to the BMX Bandits, do yourself a favour and get any of the Creation albums. Just remember what Kurt Cobain once said: "If I could be in any other band, it would be BMX Bandits".
