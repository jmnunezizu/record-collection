Chocolateclay - Chocolateclay
Cat – LP-2610 / 1977 / US

Lovers of AOR, Blue-eyed Soul, funky rock, and straight up funky soul pay attention: this is for you! The combination produced by George 'Chocolate' Perry and Clay Cropper deliver the perfect right-in-the-middle blend. Not too smooth, and not too funky. Just spot on!

Coming straight from Miami based Cat label, here's Chocolateclay. Perry is well known and has played bass for Milton Wright, Little Beaver, Latimore, and Timmy Thomas. Pretty much every big name in the Miami soul scene. Clay Cropper was also a well-known session musician in the Miami scene and worked with Betty Wright and George McCrae amongst others.

It includes the great opening tune "My Uncle Funky", "I Ain't Mad At You" with a great funky drum intro, "Two Different Worlds" that combines Steely Dan's Aja with some Hawaiian vibes, "Sweet Mary", and the classic "Free (I'll Always Be)" which is a personal favourite.

The first time I heard this album was on Spotify. I was hoping that listening to the original LP was going to be a different experience, and indeed it was. The album sounds crisp, punchy, and with great dynamics. The Spotify version, however, sounds flat, lifeless, and reminds me of the sound a 96kbps MP3 file would deliver. Beware!
