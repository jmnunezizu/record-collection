Rance Allen Group - Say My Friend
Capitol Records – ST-11613 / 1977 / US

This is one of the last "Sky High Productions", released in the same year as "Music Is My Sanctuary" by Gary Bartz.

The first half of the opening track "Truth is Marching On" has a nice disco vibe, but doesn't carry that distinctive Mizell production sound. The second half, just like the outro, is where it gets interesting.

"Reason to Survive" is quite nice, but not a classic. Nice string arrangements, lovely vocals, and many classic Mizell-production elements. It's good in its own right but falls short when compared to some of the other Mizell productions from previous albums.

The standout track is "Peace of Mind". Classic Mizell sound right there. The hook is great. Many late 90's house productions sound like this – the ones that you could find in a David Morales set. This song is the main reason I set myself on a mission to find a copy of this album.

Side B is quite mellow for me, and somewhat weak if I had to be blunt. The "Outro" is there to remind us to flip the record and start over, ha.

Not my favourite Mizell production, but still some great gems to be found here. The artwork is nice and stands out, but not iconic.
