Super Furry Animals - Fuzzy Logic
Creation Records – CRELP190 / 1996 / UK

The last great Creation sign by Alan McGee, perhaps?

Not as good and cohesive as Radiator (my favourite Furries album), but a great one nonetheless. The first 2 tracks on the album give us the perfect introduction to the Furry world. From the opening track "God! Show Me Magic" with the rock-infused guitars and whimsical keys, to the sweetness of Gruff's vocal performance on "Fuzzy Birds".

Besides the opening track, 3 other singes were released: "Something 4 The Weekend", "Hometown Unicorn", and "If You Don't Want Me To Destroy You" – 90s classics!

I did not have the chance to see the Furries live in the 90s, but I managed to go to the "Fuzzy Logic/Radiator Tour" in 2016. What a wonderful night that was.

The album was remastered for the 20th anniversary, but an OG copy is not prohibitive...yet.
