Oliver Nelson - Skull Session
summary: Flying Dutchman – BDL1-0825 / Promo / 1975 / US

Alright, let's be honest, regardless of how good the music on this LP is, you MUST have it for the cover alone. Can it get any better than this? Bob Grossé produced an iconic cover. A cover that, if it weren't on a jazz album, would probably be a t-shirt.

The album is like 2 albums in one. Half of it is groovy and funky. The other half is straight-up jazz and big band. Oliver Nelson and producer Bob Thiele got together a tier-1 selection of session musicians. Jim Gordon, the great 70s drummer with one of the saddest stories in rock music; Shelly Manne, Lee Ritenour, Lonnie Liston Smith, Willie Bobo, and many others.

Let's start by talking about "Skull Session", the opening track. It's murky, dark, gloomy, mysterious, and with a lead synth that invites you to cross that line between good and bad. Come on in!

"Dumpy Mama" is super groovy with a drum-break intro. Probably the one that awards the album that "rare groove" title. Things get quiet and mellow on "In a Japanese Garden" with a flute lead – I've always liked this track.

For me, the best track is "Flight for Freedom". The first time I heard this song I thought: Steely Dan. And yeah, it's Steely Dan without Fagen's vocals and perhaps a bit jazzier. The song is emotional and evocative with a lovely drum-break intro by Jim Gordon. His drumming is out of this world. However, the top prize goes to Lee Ritenour or Dennis Budimir. What an exquisite guitar solo! Similar to "Kid Charlemagne" or "Don't Take Me Alive" by The Dan – the song slowly builds up and explodes when the solo comes in. Just listen to the guitar lick at 3:05 – marvellous.

I can't recommend this album enough. You must own it.
