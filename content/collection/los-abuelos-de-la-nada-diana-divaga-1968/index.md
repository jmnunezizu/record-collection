Discos CBS - 21.944 (Promo) / 1968 / Argentina

"And you: what do you do? Are you in a band?" – Mr Brenner asked Miguel.

"Yes, I'm in a band." – Miguel lied.

"And what's the name?"

Miguel did not hesitate and replied "Padre de los piojos, abuelos de la nada" – remembering a phrase by the great author Leopoldo Marechal.

"You have a recording session in 3 months at CBS Columbia. Find out at what time it is; Jacko Zeller will be the producer." – Mr Brenner sentenced.

Pipo Lernoud and Miguel left feeling both joyous and terrified about what had just happened. They went to Plaza Francia (a square) to find the musicians for a band that had _just_ been created.

The first "Los Abuelos de la Nada" lineup consisted of Héctor "Pomo" Lorenzo (future Pappo's Blues, Invisible & Spinetta-Jade) on drums, the brothers Micky and Alberto Lara on rhythm guitar and bass respectively; and Eduardo "Mayoneso" Fanacoa on organ. To make it even more legendary, "Diana Divaga" features Claudio Gabis (future Manal) on guitar, and Pappo on "Tema en Flu sobre el Planeta".

Originally, the song was about 4 minutes long; a length that went beyond the arbitrary 3-minute mark annoyingly defined by radio stations for airplay. Unfortunately, the song was shortened to about 3 minutes to comply with this rule. This, of course, bothered the band massively. It was, however, the way things were done in the 60s.

Both songs are fantastic and, "Diana Divaga" in particular, is quite psychedelic with its sound effects and cello arrangements.

This single is extremely rare, seldom-seen, highly sought after; and any other rarity adjective we can throw at it. Mine is a promo copy that has some damage in the label to remove the text that indicates so. Probably to be able to sell it? Who knows. If anyone has a repro sleeve, please let me know.
