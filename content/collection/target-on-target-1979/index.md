Target - On Target
Sunshine Records – SPD-31 / 1979 / US

I was lucky enough to source a copy of this ultra-rare album a few years ago. It was released in 1979 by Sunshine Records – never re-pressed nor re-issued on CD or vinyl.

There are 3 wonderful songs. "What I'm Gonna Do", probably my favourite, is a beautiful 2-step tune with a lavish string arrangement. Just hear the intro and you'll get why. "All The Lights are Out" has that classic soul sound with a raw yet impeccable vocal performance.

"Two-Faced" is the one that brings the funk. A disco-like string arrangement and another great vocal performance with good harmonies. This is the one that will get you moving.

Bonus track: I quite like the way "For Who We Are" starts with classical guitar and the strings. The build-up is quite powerful. It's a great tune with a wonderful vocal performance. A word of caution: be prepared for the sax and "oh sweet loving" :)

I know nothing about this band and there's little to no information to be found on the Internet. If you happen to know more, please share!
