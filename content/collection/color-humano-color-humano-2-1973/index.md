Talent ‎– I-404, Microfon ‎– I-404 (1st) / 1973 / Argentina

Towards the end of 1972, the always versatile and multi-instrumentalist David Lebón left Color Humano to join Spinetta's band Pescado Rabioso on bass - thus leaving the drum stool vacant. Oscar Moro had recently been part of Huinca alongside his old Los Gatos bandmate Litto Nebbia. In need of a new drummer, Edelmiro Molinari asked Moro to join his band – and he accepted.

Moro brought a more hard rock sound to the group. The old folksy style found in songs like "Padre Sol, Madre Sal" (Color Humano – Microfon, 1972) were now a thing of the past. This final line-up was tight, solid, and definitely the best.

Color Humano played at the B.A. Rock III Festival, at the end of 1972, and can be seen in the "Rock Hasta Que Se Ponga El Sol" film from 1973.

The album, intended to be a 2-LP set, was recorded between March and June 1973 at Estudios Phonalex. The label, however, had different plans and decided that the album should be released as 2 single-LPs. Vol. 3 would be released 1 year later.

Sample lovers will enjoy the drum break intro of "Sangre del Sol". The added percussion is really nice, and gives the tune a latin vibe.

Whenever "La Tierra del Gitano" comes along, I can't help but sing "Astronomy Domine" by Pink Floyd. The song has several changes, and the drumming is sparse with a lot of space between the hits. The bass is tight and the guitar arrangements work pretty well. Really nice.

Totally recommended, and perhaps my fave out of the 3 LPs.
