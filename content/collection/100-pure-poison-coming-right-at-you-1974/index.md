100% Pure Poison - Coming Right at You
EMI International – INS 3001 / 1974 / UK

Incredibly sought-after LP by a group of American military men, stationed in Germany who managed to get an album recorded and released in the UK by EMI in 1974.

This is another one of those albums that I wanted to like because of the cover.

"Windy C" – what an absolute rare-groove classic. It sounds extremely fresh even today, with a proto gang-rapping style reminiscent of "Rapper's Delight" by The Sugarhill Gang – but released 6 years earlier. I first heard the tune in the 1995 compilation "Capitol Rare (Funky Notes From The West Coast) (Vol. 2)" – which, by the way, it's a great comp. Check out both volumes. It's a nice way to get some 2-tone and rare-groove classics for little money.

The album is quite enjoyable and includes other great tunes like "Puppet on a Chain" and "No More City, No More Chain" which reminds me of the Soul Searchers.

Coming across an original pressing is quite hard given the album's obscurity and high-demand status. However, @dynamitecuts released a limited edition 2x7" in 2018 (which I own, of course), and earlier this year Japan's @pvinerecords reissued the album in full. So there are plenty of options to own a copy!
