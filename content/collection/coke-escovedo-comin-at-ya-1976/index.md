Coke Escovedo - Comin' At Ya!
Mercury – SRM-1-1085 / 1976 / US

Second effort by the ex-Santana Coke Escovedo, released in 1976 on Mercury records. It features Gabor Szabo, Joe Henderson, and Courtial's Errol Knowles.

Yes, I also went after this record because of "I Wouldn't Change A Thing" and the spectacular and "punchy" cover art. However, there's more to be found in this record. Let's take a look, shall we?

Let's take a moment to appreciate the soulfulness in the guitar work of "Something So Simple" by Abel Zarate. This song is packed with exceptional arrangements and top production. They don't make them like this anymore.

The mood gets disco with "Stay With Me", written by Jose Feliciano, which features a sax solo by the one and only Joe Henderson. Top tune.

The intro to "Hangin' On" reminds me of Bill Conti's soundtrack for Rocky. The song gets more soulful with an epic chorus, but the strings arrangement definitely give me that vibe. Excellent tune too.

I prefer Coke's version of "I Wouldn't Change A Thing" over Johnny Bristol's original from 1975. There's nothing bad with the original, it's a lovely song with a "Love Unlimited Orchestra" kind of sound. However, Coke's version gets bonus points because of 1. the opening drum-break; and 2. the disco groove.

Not all the songs are instant classics, but the production value is great. If you're still not convinced, just get it for the cover and proudly display it in your music room.
