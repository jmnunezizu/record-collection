Oasis - Supersonic
Creation Records – CRE 176T / 1994 / UK

Oasis are the band that made me discover, and ultimately cemented, my love for Creation Records. 

This is where it all started. Noel claimed that he composed the song in 30 minutes in December of '93, while they were recording "Bring it on Down" for a potential single release. The Real People were there too, but I will stay away from the controversy.

As with all Oasis releases that matter, the cover design was in the hands of Brian Cannon of Microdot. The cover depicts the band, and their instruments, at Monnow Valley Studios in Wales.

The B-sides are not that strong, but "Take Me Away" is quite sweet. Classic Noel. It is missing, however, the white label demo of "Columbia", which was included in the CD single.
