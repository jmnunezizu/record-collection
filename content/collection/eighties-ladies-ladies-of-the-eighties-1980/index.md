Eighties Ladies - Ladies of the Eighties
Uno Melodic Records – UM-0001 / 1980 / US

Ladies and gentlemen here it is, the one-off album produced by Roy Ayers (@realroyayers) for his Uno Melodic label in 1980. It features the group "Eighties Ladies" that includes the one and only Sylvia Striplin (ex Aquarian Dream).

Just like with the RAMP album, most songwriting credits go to Roy Ayers and Edwin Birdsong.

The classic "Turned On To You" as well as the monster boogie-funk-jazz killer "Ladies of The Eighties" are included here. If you listen to "Tell Him" you can find some of the production elements that Jamiroquai (@jamiroquaihq) made famous in the 90's – just listen to that bass!

The entire album is super solid and quite enjoyable. For fans of Johnny Hammond's Gears, James Mason, etc.
