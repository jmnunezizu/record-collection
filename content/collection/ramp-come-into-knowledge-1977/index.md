ABC Blue Thumb – BT-6028 / 1977 / US

Where to begin with this one, what a monster of a record! Roy Ayers (@realroyayers) produced and wrote most of the songs in this LP. It also has some originals by Edwin Birdsong (ex Roy Ayers Ubiquity).

In 1990, A Tribe Called Quest (@atcq) sampled "Daylight" for their excellent song "Bonita Applebum". Sometimes samples "are" the song and others, like in this case, "add" to the song.

Erykah Badu (@erykahbadu) also sampled the intro track "American Promise" for "Amerykahn Promise" in her 2007 album "New Amerykah Part One (4th World War)".

"I Just Love You", a cover version of Ayers' "Everybody Loves The Sunshine", "Come Into Knowledge", "Try, Try, Try", and the wonderful "Look Into The Sky" are other brilliant tracks in this album.

Quite rare album. Don't hesitate to buy it if you have the chance. You won't regret it.
