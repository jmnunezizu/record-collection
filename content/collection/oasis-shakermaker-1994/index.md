Oasis - Shakermaker
Creation Records – CRE 182T / 1994 / UK

"Shakermaker" includes one my favourites Oasis B-Sides: "D'Yer Wanna Be A Spaceman?". It wasn't like that when I first heard the song in the 90s. I think that changed as I grew older. "Spaceman" and "Fade Away" are siblings. They touch on the same idea of dreams you have as a kid that may or may not realise. "Spaceman", unlike "Fade Away", has a more optimistic message. It's childish, dreamy, and that works brilliantly with Noel's vocals.

The cover designed by Brian Cannon is fantastic, and the colours on the 12" single really pop!

"Alive" is forgettable. "Bring It On Down (Live)" was not included on this 12" and is only available on the CD single.
