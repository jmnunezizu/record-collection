Eddie Russ - Take a Look at Yourself
Monument – MG 7620 / 1978 / US

I don't remember when nor how I came across this album, but I do recall it was "Take a Look at Yourself", and the funky keys, the one that set me on a quest to find a copy. What an absolute banger!

"Tea Leaves" is the other one with an infectious groove. What a bass line! Am I the only one who hears a Todd Rundgren influence in the synths, particularly in the intro?

All 3 albums by Eddie Russ are worth owning. This one and "See The Light" are absolute must haves for any jazz-funk aficionado.

Play it loud while gazing at the wonderful mandala cover.
