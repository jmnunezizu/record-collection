Fantasy – F-9473 (Promo) / 1975 / US

Debut album by Portand, Oregon-based R&B group Pleasure. In 1974, Grover Washington recommended Pleasure to reach out to Wayne Henderson, who had recently left The Jazz Crusaders and founded his own record production company At-Home Productions. Henderson, who was impressed with what he heard, helped them get a recording deal with Fantasy Records. In total, Henderson produced 4 albums. The first 3 being absolutely essential!

The album includes the rare groove classic "Bouncy Lady" – which I'm sure the Acid Jazz scene took inspiration from in the early 90's.

The opening track "Dust Yourself Off" sets the tone perfectly for what Pleasure are all about. Great musicianship, fantastic arrangements, and groove...plenty of groove.

Other standout tracks are "Reality", a cover version of "Midnight at The Oasis" that was also covered by @thebrandnewheavies_ in the 90's, "Plastic People", and "Straight Ahead" which probably competes head to head with "Bouncy Lady" for the best song in the album.

I was extremely lucky to find a MINT promo copy some years ago.
