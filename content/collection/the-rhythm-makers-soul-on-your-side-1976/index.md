Vigor Records – VI 7002 (Promo) / 1976 / US

No, it's not the Beatles' White Album – although it looks quite similar with the positioning of the rubber stamp in the lower right corner.

About 45 years ago, DJ's received an advanced white-label promo album named "New Release" by The Rhythm Makers. The labels on this release are different from the later promo copy and there is no mention of Vigor (subsidiary of De-Lite) on the labels. Later that same year, it would get a proper release as "Soul On Your Side" with the green cover that we all know.

The opening track "Can You Feel It", as well as "Zone" and "Monterey" are excellent funk instrumentals. Especially "Monterey", great drumming and tight bass line.

"Soul On Your Side" is the one that we all know. What a tune! When they changed their name to G.Q. they took the basic elements of the song, re-recorded and re-purposed it as "Disco Nights (Rock Freak)" which delivers a more polished sound. However, I prefer the rawness found in the original.

Special mention goes to the slow jam "You're My Last Girl". Great vocal harmonies there.

This promo copy is super rare. I've never seen another copy. Let me know if you have or have seen one before.
