Disc Jockey – Serie Oro 14011 / 1973 / Argentina

Between the end of 1972 and beginning of 1973, Anotonio Juan Sanchez (the one and only [Johnny Allon](https://www.instagram.com/johnnyallonmax)) and the trio Mandragora (led by the Torres brothers) decided to form Caballo Vapor.

Johnny Allon had some contacts in the Disc Jockey record label, and had agreed to record Caballo Vapor's debut album. The band's musical style was quite a departure from Johnny's previous efforts. In fact, the style was so different, that Johnny decided to release the album under his real name – rather than his stage persona. This was done to protect the band from Johnny's disappointed fans, radio DJs and rock magazines.

The album's style could be categorised as Rock/Blues with brass arrangements (if that makes any sense at all). A style that is seldom seen in Argentine rock.

There are some nice guitar arrangements in some of the tracks. A brass-heavy rendition to "La Balsa" by Los Gatos is included. This version is is not great and they even apologise at the end of the song! However, I'm sure it can surprise people if the track is dropped at the right time!

Caballo Vapor released a couple of singles after this album, that went unnoticed, and disbanded shortly after. One of them, probably their best effort, is the funky-groovy "Para Cantarle a Soledad" from 1975. This single is quite rare.


Not essential album that is hard to come by. It has never been reissued and will probably never be.
