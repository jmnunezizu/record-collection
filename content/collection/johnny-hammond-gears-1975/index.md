Johnny Hammond - Gears
Milestone – M-9062 / 1975 / US

In 1975, the Mizell Brothers, behind their "Sky High Productions", produced a trio of jazz-funk albums that probably rank amongst the best of all time: "Places and Spaces" by Donald Byrd, "The Shadow Do!" by Gary Bartz, and my favourite "Gears" by Johnny Hammond.

About 10 years ago, I was listening to "Places and Spaces" by Donald Byrd. Through the power of a recommendation algorithm, "Los Conquistadores Chocolates" came up next. This sounds familiar – I thought. Of course it does, Jamiroquai borrowed the chord progression for their debut 12" "When You're Gonna Learn?" (check out 0:58 sec) released in 1992!

When I played the album in full I couldn't believe it. Every tune is an absolute monster. The sonics are out of this world. Every single instrument is clear and the production value is outstanding. The groove produced by Harvey Mason's in-the-pocket drumming and Chuck Rainey's bass is superb. Listen to Chuck in "Shifting Gears"! The Mizell Brothers worked with the best. Sometimes jazz-funk albums are all about the musicianship but lack a bit of soul. This is not one of those, my friends. Just listen to the closing track "Can't We Smile?" and judge for yourself.

This is not an extremely rare album, but it's normally beat up. A copy in top condition commands high price. In 2015, BGP Records (@acerecordsltd) released an expanded version in a gatefold double LP which includes alternative versions and unreleased songs. It sounds great and it's worth getting it just for the unreleased tracks.
