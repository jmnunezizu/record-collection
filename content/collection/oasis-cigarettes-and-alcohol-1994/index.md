Oasis - Cigarettes & Alcohol
Creation Records – CRE 190T / 1994 / UK

Brian Cannon couldn't have been more rock 'n roll with that cover.

"Fade Away" is a stellar tune. The production could've been better, and Even Owen Morris recognised that he didn't do the song enough justice. I like the lo-fi, DIY punky style, though. Liam's been including it in his sets along with "Headshrinker", and that puts a smile on my face. The acoustic "Warchild Version", that was included in the "Help" album and Japanese-only "Don't Go Away" single - it's jaw-dropping!

What a crime not to include "Listen Up" in this 12". Yes, "I Am The Walrus" is a good cover, but I would swap it for "Listen Up" without hesitation.

All of you Oasis fans, search for the "Fade Away" and "Listen Up" versions from the Commodore Ballroom, Vancouver, from 29th January 1995. The sound is phenomenal and the band is super tight! Man, I've listened to that bootleg so many times!
