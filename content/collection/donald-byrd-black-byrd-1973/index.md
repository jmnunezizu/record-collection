Donald Byrd - Black Byrd
Blue Note – BN-LA047-F / 1973 / US

The one that started it all. The first collaboration between Donald Byrd and the Mizell brothers. Ranking amongst the best-selling Blue Note jazz-funk albums of all time.

Many classics are included in this LP. "Black Byrd" and "Slop Jar Blues" could have been part of any Blaxploitation soundtrack of the time; "Love's So Far Away" wouldn't feel a stranger in Bobbi Humphrey's "Blacks and Blues" LP as it features a lovely flute lead by Roger Glen. Similarly with "Sky High" – delightful back and forth between Byrd and Glen sharing the lead – and yes, more vocal harmonies!

Without a doubt, the top tune is "Where Are We Going?". All the elements needed for a Sunday morning classic are present here.

The album is tight and cohesive with great moments, and it's a great listen to understand how the collaboration between this lot started and how things evolved. Can't compete with "Places" but that's a given. An absolute must in any "Sky High Productions" collection.
