Trova – XT-80032 (1st) / 1972 / Argentina

In November 1971, the B.A. Rock II Festival took place in Buenos Aires across 4 Saturdays. In one of those afternoons, an unnamed band comprised of Emilio del Guercio and Rodolfo Garcia (both ex Almendra), Héctor Starc, and Hugo González Neira; played for the first time. It wasn't until March 1972, at Teatro Lorange, that their official debut as Aquelarre happened.

Recorded in 4-track tape and released in 1972, this is by far Aquelarre in their most raw form.


Hector Starc (bola de ruido)

1. Jugador, campos para luchar - Raw and aggressive guitar licks from Starc. The band is quite solid.
2. Yo seré el animal, vos serás mi dueño -  Clavicordio y fantastic guitar work by Starc. Jazz-rock arrangements. This could have easily been part of Almendra II. 
3. Aventura en el árbol - Starc is on fire! Vocal harmonies reminiscent of Almendra.
4. Jugador, campos para luchar - Probably the most prog-rock track. Harpsichord solo.
5. Cantemos tu nombre - Folk and vocal harmonies. Quite pastoral.
6. Movimiento - Hard-rock wah-wah guitar. 

Aquelarre in their most raw form.
Aquelarre played for the first time in the B.A. Rock II Festival in 1971
Aquelarre's debut was on 17th March 1972 at Teatro Lorange.
