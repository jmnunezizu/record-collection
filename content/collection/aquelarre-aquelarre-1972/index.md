Trova – XT-80032 (1st) / 1972 / Argentina

In November 1971, the B.A. Rock II Festival took place in Buenos Aires across 4 Saturdays. In one of those afternoons, an unnamed band comprised of Emilio del Guercio and Rodolfo Garcia (both ex Almendra), Héctor Starc (ex Alta Tensión), and Hugo González Neira; played for the first time. It wasn't until March 1972, at Teatro Lorange, that their official debut as Aquelarre happened.

Recorded in 4-track tape at Estudios ION and released in 1972 with a cover artwork designed by Emilio Del Guercio; this is Aquelarre at their most raw form.

The album opens with the powerful "Canto", which sets the tone for what comes next. Starc's guitar sound is...incendiary. Incendiary. 

Slow-tempo and beautiful "Yo Seré El Animal, Vos Serás Mi Dueño" follows next, offering a more jazz-rock sound. This song could have easily been part of Almendra II.

Clocking at nearly 9 minutes, "Aventura en el Arbol" is without a doubt the standout track. Drum break intro, powerful licks by Starc, and harpsychord. How about some wah-wah? Yes, please.

The rest of the album is solid, and it's an essential album for sure. The hard-rock guitar sound still drives the grand majority of the album with a few exceptions. This is what early-70s-Argentine rock was all about. Fantastic!
