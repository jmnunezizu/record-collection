Larry Saunders The Prophet of Soul - Stranger
Soul International Records – SLP-100 / 1976 / US

Originally released in 1970 on the obscure Sound of Soul label. It was re-released in 1976 and probably remixed with a different track listing but replacing "Where Did Peace Go" with "Darling I Love You". It also comes with another cover with Larry sitting at the piano – which I prefer over this one.

It includes the absolute classic "Fly Away Love Bird" that was also recorded by The Whole Darn Family on their "Has Arrived" album - released on the same label. Both "Story of my Love" and "You Beat me Baby" bring a bit of funk to the album. The first one with great drumming, wah-wah guitar, and organ; and the latter with a lovely brass section. In every single tune, Larry's vocal performance is incredible with great delivery. Just listen to "Three Strikes on Me". If that's not soul, what is?

If you like Ron Henderson's "I'll Be Around" – check out "This is My Prayer".

If you've never heard this guy before, you'll be left wondering why? Honestly, you need to remember that this rare-soul album was originally released in 1970; and is capable of giving the greats Donny Hathaway and Stevie Wonder some serious competition!
