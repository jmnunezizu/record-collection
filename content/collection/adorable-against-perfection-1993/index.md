Adorable - Against Perfection
Creation Records – CRELP 138 / 1993 / UK

Typically given the Shoegaze label, however, I found it to be more Alt-Rocky than dreamy and/or hazy. Perhaps, given it came out in 1993 and released on Creation, made critics call it Shoegaze – but I don't think I'm fully convinced. Certainly closer to Ride than Slowdive or My Bloody Valentine. 

It's a good album, although monotonous at times. I love the opening track "Glorious", and the dreamy guitar work on "I Know You Too Well" with the fat bassline sounds great. This one, my friends, earns the Shoegaze badge. Side B opens with "Sistine Chapel Ceiling" – another favourite.

Originally the LP was released in the UK and Spain in very limited quantities, and it's seldom seen in record shops. It was later reissued by Music On Vinyl in 2018. I don't know how I missed this album during the 90s, but I'm glad I discovered it.
