Teenage Fanclub - Thirteen
Creation Records – CRE LP 144 / 1993 / UK

In an interview with Vice in 2016, Norman Blake chose "Thirteen" as his least favourite Fannies album. He's got nothing against the songs per se, but did not enjoy the never-ending recording process that took months.

For some reason, this album was the last piece of the puzzle to complete my Teenage Fanclub albums collection, and it has some added historical value too. It was the copy photographed for the original Creation Records website back in the late 90s.

This album is the perfect blend between the rawness of "Bandwagonesque" and what was to come next in "Grand Prix" and beyond.

It includes the classics "Radio", "Norman 3", but it's also packed with wonderful tunes like McGinley's "Escher", "Commercial Alternative", and others. Ignore what Norman said. It's a brilliant album and it's been going up in price lately. Don't sleep!
