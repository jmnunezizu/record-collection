Mandioca - MLP 332 (1st) / 1970 / Argentina

When The Beatniks split up, Moris began to perform live as a solo artist.

His debut album, released by Mandioca, was recorded at Estudios TNT in several sessions; produced by Jorge Alvarez and Pedro Pujó (founder and co-founder respectively), and features Pappo, Richard Green (ex Los In), and Claudio Gabis and Javier Martinez of Manal.

The album is quite lo-fi, even though it was recorded in an Ampex four-track recorder – quite advanced for the time!

In 2013, Rolling Stone ranked the album 11 in the "100 Best Albums of Argentine Rock" and it's indeed an absolute classic.

Songs like "El Oso", "Ayer Nomás", "Pato Trabaja en Una Carnicería", and "Escúchame Entre el Ruido" are part of the collective unconscious in Argentina. Everbody knows them.

Los Gatos recorded "Ayer Nomás" in 1967, and released it as the B side to "La Balsa". They did, however, change the original lyrics written by Moris and Pipo Lernoud; because they were afraid it would be censored. At the time, Argentina was under a military dictatorship and the song was quite intense. The version in this album includes the original lyrics.

Moris was with Los Gatos when they recorded the single "Madre Escúchame". At one point, he started jamming "De Nada Sirve" and improvising its lyrics right at the spot. Nebbia, and everybody else, were so impressed by the performance that decided to hand Moris the tape. He would later add a bass line using a guitar, and percussion played by Javier Martínez for the album version.

In 1973, the album was reissued with a different cover designed by Juan Gatti and included "Juan, El Noble Caballero" as a bonus track.

The original Mandioca version is really hard to find (like all Mandiocas!) so if you do see it, don't hesitate!
