Leo's Sunshipp - We Need Each Other
Lyon's Record Co., Inc. – L-1000 / 1978 / US

I remember going through the "Rare Groove A to Z" book and seeing this cover art. Wow! I thought. I better like this one because the artwork is gorgeous. I don't know if it was the connection with the "Ship" matches that transported me to my days as a child setting things on fire, or the Joker-purple backdrop that simply popped. Whatever it was, I was hooked.

The album is probably one of my favourites of the soul/funk/rare groove genre. Every single tune is an absolute classic.

Sadly, they never managed to record anything else because Johnny Simone, one of the singers, fell ill during the production of the album and died of cancer. The remaining members decided to stop the production and the album was shelved. The label thought differently and released the album with alternative instrumental versions.
