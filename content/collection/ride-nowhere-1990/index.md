Ride - Nowhere
Creation Records – CRELP 074 / 1990 / UK

Normally filed under shoegaze, but considered to be an impostor by many – this is Ride's debut on Creation Records.

Yes, "Vapour Trail" is the one that gets all the attention (and Spotify's 17m plays confirms it).

However, the opening track "Seagull" is where it's at. Top tune. The drumming is insane, and the backward guitars with top vocal harmonies give it that sense of neo-psych that is alien to shoegaze records.

This has become an in-demand album lately. A VG+ copy commands £100+. Insane.
