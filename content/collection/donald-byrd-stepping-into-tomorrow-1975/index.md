Donald Byrd - Stepping Into Tomorrow
Blue Note – BN-LA368-G / 1975 / US

Another great production from the Mizell brothers for their "Sky High Productions" and released in 1975, here's "Stepping Into Tomorrow".

Album-opener "Stepping Into Tomorrow" hits you right in the face with the big explosion and sets the tone. It's like the continuation of the jet opening the "Black Byrd" LP with "Flight-Time".

I've always loved the song "Flowerz" by Armand Van Helden feat. Roland Clark from 1999. It was quite a different house track for the time. The melody was catchy and jazzy with a brilliant bass line, and Roland's voice was the perfect match. What I didn't know until I went down the "Sky High Productions" rabbit hole was that it was sampled from "Think Twice"! This is another great example of a brilliant producer capitalising on the best part of a song and making a record out of it. The sample cames up towards the last minute of the song. Check it out!

The rest of the album has that summer breeze style found in all the collaborations between Byrd and the Mizell brothers. Side B is the weaker in my opinion, but a great listen anyway. "Makin' It" is a great side opener and "You Are The World" delivers that "chasing" style funk.

Not at the same level as "Places", but a great listen.
