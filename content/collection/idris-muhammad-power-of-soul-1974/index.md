Idris Muhammad - Power of Soul
Kudu – KU-17 / 1974 / US

I've always found the opening track "Power Of Soul", a Hendrix cover, a stranger in this album. When the brass hook goes quiet and leaves some space for the song to breathe, it gets better, but it doesn't quite work for me.

If you're looking for soul jazz at its best, just listen to "Piece Of Mind". Everything works in this song. Every break and hook is executed to perfection. It's groovy, moody, and full of air. The instrumentation breathes.

The intro to "Loran's Dance"... the Rhodes piano, Idris' drumming, the percussion, the shaker, the guitar, the brass section – everything is absolutely superb. Famously sampled by The Beastie Boys in their "Paul's Boutique" album from 1989.

It took me a while to find a copy of this album. I remember coming slightly below the winning bid in many eBay auctions. One day, I got tired of losing and took the plunge. It was not cheap, but the right price to pay for a clean copy.

This is an essential album. It was released with 2 different covers, but this is the iconic one.
