Edward Ball - Catholic Guilt
Creation Records – CRELP 200 / 1997 / UK

Ed Ball (ex-Television Personalities and other Creation acts) released his third solo album on Creation Records in 1997.

Ed is joined by Martin Carr, Tim Brown, and Bob Cieka – all from The Boo Radleys; but the list doesn't stop there. Andy Bell (Ride/Oasis) and his then girlfriend Idha (also on Creation) appear too. The list ends with Nick Hayward (Haircut One Hundred), who joins with vocals on "Never Live to Love Again".

I remember watching the Creation documentary "Upside Down" and listening to "The Mill Hill Self Hate Club" for the first time. What a lovely tune.

Since then, I've only seen the album once and didn't hesitate. It's seldom-seen to say the least, and I'd be surprised if more than a few hundred copies were pressed.

Get it if you're into UK 90s sound with string and brass arrangements, exquisite pop, and catchy tunes.
