Harlem Sound – SA 001, Lu Jun Productions – 2001 / 1974 / US

The legendary Harlem soul and funk LP from '73 – independently relased on the Lu Jon label. The Ray Alexander Technique was the house band at the Apollo theatre. Lo-fi soul and funk at its best.

There are several great tunes in this LP, ranging from pure sweet soul in "Taking the Long Way Home" or the raw funk with a killer bass line in "My Special One". The opening song "Let's Talk" is the one that does it for me.

The original press is quite sought-after and rare. Luckily, Now-Again reissued a remastered 2xLP version with bonus tracks in 2020.
