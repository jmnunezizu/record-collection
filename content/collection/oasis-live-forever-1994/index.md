Oasis - Live Forever
Creation Records – CRE 185T / 1994 / UK

I always found "Cloudburst" to be an underrated tune – and what a tune it is! Tony's drumming gives the song exactly what it asks for: precise raw power. The entire rhythm section is tight and the hook is catchy. Perhaps influenced by "Standing High" by the "Stone Roses", but with a murkier tone, I'd say. Another favourite B-side.

The acoustic version of "Up In The Sky" is lovely, although too bright!

The live version of "Supersonic" is only included in the CD single, "so go and buy it".
