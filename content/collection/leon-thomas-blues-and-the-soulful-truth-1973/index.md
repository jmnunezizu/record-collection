Leon Thomas - Blues And The Soulful Truth
Flying Dutchman – FD 10155 / 1973 / US

Isn't it great when eye-catching artwork that simply pops is married with great music? What a cover by Hideo Yamashita, and what a great album this is!

Leon Thomas, with the help of producer Bob Thiele, and an enviable line up of top session musicians comprised of Bernard Purdie, Airto Moreira, Pee Wee Ellis, Cecil Payne, Dick Griffin, and Stanley Clarke – just to name a few, released this top album in 1973.

It's got jazz, rock, blues, funk, and soul so I'm sure you'll find something here.

The combination of the bass line from Stanley Clarke and Airto's ghost-notes-filled drumming that opens up "Gypsy Queen" is magnificent. The groove slowly lures you into the song, until you feel completely trapped and lost within an infectious groove. "Shape Your Mind To Die", with Jesse Kilpatrick on the drums this time, continues with the same evil-soul style. Leon's pure evil laugh at 2:40 sends me the chills every single time!

"Love Each Other" is a lovely soulful tune. It couldn't be any other way with that title. Nice brass section and backing vocals.

Also, this album includes the classic "China Doll", which is the one (besides the cover, of course) that made me seek a copy of this album.

Top album. Great musicians. Iconic artwork. Get it.
