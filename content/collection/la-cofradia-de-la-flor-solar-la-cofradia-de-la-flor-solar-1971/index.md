Microfon - I-293 / 1971 / Argentina

La Cofradía de la Flor Solar was a hippie community of artists, craftsmen and musicians from La Plata – a city situated 50-km away from Buenos Aires.

Their live debut was on 21st September 1968, with Hugo "Pascua" García on guitar, Morcy Requena on bass, and Manija Paz on drums. At the end of the same year, they recorded a demo tape with the help of journalist Miguel Grinberg. In 1969, Juan F. "Kubero" Díaz joined on guitar and vocals; the band managed to release the "Sombra Fugaz Por La Ciudad" / "La Mufa" single on RCA, but unfortunately went unnoticed.

Rumour has it that, shortly afterwards, they recorded an album on Mandioca. From these sessions, however, only "Juana" ever saw the light; and was included on the hard-to-find "Pidamos Peras a Mandioca" compilation.

Probably their most important show was at the B.A. Rock festival in November 1970.

Finally, in 1971, Jorge Alvarez (ex Mandioca) got them a deal with Microfon. The album was recorded in about 20 hours at Estudios Phonal. Kubero Díaz and Nestor Paul wrote all the songs. Quique Gonatti and Skay Beilinson (later on Los Redontitos de Ricota) played guest guitar; and Billy Bond joined as producer. The gatefold cover was designed by Kubero and El Mono Cohen (later to be known as Rocambole and designer of all Redonditos de Ricota covers).

The album is a combination of Psyche, Blues, and Hard Rock. The band is super tight, and the guitar work is outstanding. My favourite is probably "Fiesta de Amor en el Cielo". For some reason, it reminds me of the kind of sound Babasonicos had in the album "Babasónica" (acknowledging the differences, of course!). Is it just me?

This is probably the most psychedelic album ever recorded in Argentina, and it's an absolute masterpiece. If you're intrigued about 70s-Argentine rock, try to give this one a listen. Totally recommended.
