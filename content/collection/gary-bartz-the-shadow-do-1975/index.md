Gary Bartz - The Shadow Do!
Prestige – P-10092 / 1975 / US

Produced by the legendary Mizell brothers for their "Sky High Productions", and released in the same year as "Places and Spaces" by Donald Byrd and "Gears" by Johnny Hammond.

I came across this album after going down a rare groove rabbit hole. Not at the same level as "Places" or "Gears", but a magnificent album nonetheless. This time, the Mizell brothers chose a different set of cats as their session musicians. Harvey Mason was replaced with Howard King and Chuck Rainey with Michael Henderson. This album sounds great, but it lacks a certain finesse found in the other two. Maybe I like Mason's drumming style too much!

Side A is one winner after another. The opening track "Winding Roads" is a lovely song with the classic Mizell style – very much in line with Bobbi Humphrey's "Blacks and Blues" but with sax! When I discovered the album I couldn't stop playing "Mother Nature" – what an intro! "Love Tones" is another great one. A Tribe Called Quest sampled "Gentle Smiles (Saxy)" in the song "Butter" from their 1991 album "The Low End Theory". The intro might be too "saxy", but wait for the chorus to kick-in (and play the saxy for me).

The rest of the album has great tunes with a brilliant groove, but none of them can match any of the songs on side A. It's still quite solid though, and ends the album on a high note with "Incident".

Not a rare album per se, but just like the other 2 in this trio, copies are normally beat up. If you see it, get it!
