Teenage Fanclub - Bandwagonesque
Creation Records – CRE LP 106 / 1991 / UK

Creation Records is one of my favourite labels of all time. For many, 1991 is Creation's best year ever. "Bandwagonesque" by TFC, "Loveless" by My Bloody Valentine, and "Screamadelica" by Primal Scream. Do I need to say more?

What a wonderful record. Voted #1 album by Spin Magazine in 1991; beating not other than Nirvana's "Nevermind". It took the world by surprise that Norman, "The Boy Hairdresser", and the rest of the Fannies could produce such a brilliant album. It's fully packed with absolute classics: "The Concept", "What You Do To Me", "Star Sign", "Metal Baby", "Sidewinder", and "Alcoholiday". I also want to take a moment to praise McGinley's brilliant tune "I Don't Know". Simple but so effective – I love it!

I had the pleasure of going to the last gigs with Gerry back in November 2018 at the Electric Ballroom in Camden. On the first night, they played "Bandwagonesque" and "Thirteen" in full. Bittersweet moment for sure, but incredible nonetheless!
