Blur - Leisure
Food – FOODLP 6 / 1991 / UK

It's now time to break the "Creation Records" post streak for a bit, to focus on the other UK-90s giant: Blur.

I didn't pay much attention to Blur until "Parklife" / "The Great Escape", but not because I was into the Britpop war – not at all. It was just a matter of time, I think.

"Leisure" is not Blur's strongest album nor my favourite. But, it's a great album nonetheless. It's packed with great tunes like "She's So High", "Sing" (which could fit in "13" quite easily), "There's No Other Way", and the wonderful "Wear Me Down". In 1991, Blur had that late 80s/early 90s "baggy" sound. It's quite noticeable in songs like "Bad Day".

The original pressing sounds punchy for a 50-minute long LP. Totally recommended.

My copy came with an art print. I couldn't find information about it, and there are no details on Discogs. Perhaps a promo print? Leave a comment if you know.
