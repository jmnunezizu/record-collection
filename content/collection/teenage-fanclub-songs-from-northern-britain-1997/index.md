Teenage Fanclub - Songs From Northern Britain
Creation Records – CRE LP 196 / 1997 / UK

Ladies and Gentlemen, this is it! Teenage Fanclub's best album. All three composers were at the peak of their game. It's the one that reminds me of Big Star the most.

Three singles were released throughout 1997, "Ain't That Enough" by Gerry, "I Don't Want Control of You" (personal favourite), and album-opener "Start Again" – both from Norman. "Winter" was not a single, but could have easily been one. What a tune!

Both the album and the singles use photographs taken around Scotland by Scottish photographer Donald Milne. Donald released quite a limited book called "Postcards From Northern Britain" with all the images. There are more photos besides the ones used in the album and singles. The album cover is actually cropped – in the original photo you can see more of the truck next to the "Disco Fever" funfair ride. I've got a massive print of this photo that I still need to frame and hang.
