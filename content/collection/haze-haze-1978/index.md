Haze - Haze
Moonspell Records – MR 1001 / 1978 / US

Coming straight from St. Paul, MN – and with cover art that is simple yet intriguing and effective on someone like me – here's Haze.

"Love Rhyme" – what a tune! I don't know why it wasn't chosen to be included in the "Love Keeper" 45 over "I Need Somebody". The B side is great too, but "Love Rhyme"...

This is a great album from start to finish. It has a kind of Earth Wind & Fire groove and soulfulness, and it's performed and executed extremely well. If you don't believe me, check out "Time". Great catchy melodies, vocal harmonies, brass section, everything that you'd expect. "Faces, Traces, Places" is another personal favourite. If you're looking for uplifting music, don't look any further: this is for you.

The album is mega rare and a private press. It's only been re-issued on CD, but a vinyl repress is still pending. It absolutely deserves it.
