Johnny Hammond - Gambler's Life
Salvation – SAL 702 S1 / 1974 / US

This is where the road to the masterpiece "Gears" begins. The first collaboration between Johnny Hammond and the Mizell brothers, released in 1974 on the Salvation Records label.

There are several great tunes in this LP, but in many cases songs are a collection of great hooks or licks. However, some great moments are there to be had. "Star Borne" has a great Mizell groove, which could have been part of "Gears" just like that. "Back To The Projects" is out of this world. A 5-star song. The synth-driven hook, funky guitar, and unreal drumming by, I bet, James Mason (Fritz Wise is also credited) will get your head moving instantly. Once you hear the hook it is impossible to get the melody out of your head.

The intro to "Virgo Lady" reminds me of Billy Parker's Fourth World (Strata East). I don't think I ever heard that kind of jazz on a Mizell-produced album - or at least I can't remember any.

I've always felt attracted to the label design with those clouds. Of course, everything made much more sense once I found out that the Salvation label was created as a "Gospel" subsidiary of CTI Records!

Useless piece of information: the steam railroad effect on "Rhodesian Thoroughfare" comes from the Mobile Fidelity "Steam Railroading Under Thundering Skies" LP – and yes, this is an earlier label founded by Brad Miller from Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs.

This album should have been included in the "Rare Groove A to Z" book.
