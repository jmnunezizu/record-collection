Music Hall - 12.535 - Serie DM Difusión Musical (2nd Mono)/ 1965 / Argentina

In 1964, a 16 year old Litto Nebbia joined Ciro Fogliatta's band, "The Wild Cats", as the singer. At the time, the repertoire was mainly rock 'n' roll covers sung in English – like any other band of the era. Litto persuaded them to try his songs instead, which were sung in Spanish, and to change the name to "Los Gatos Salvajes". Quite a bold move – I must say.

They left the city of Rosario in 1965 and moved to Buenos Aires. It is here where they auditioned for the "Escala Musical" TV show. This gig, which included TV appearances and several shows, led them to a recording contract with Music Hall. Their first single was "La Respuesta" b/w "Hablando de Ti". This was the very first beat single sung in Spanish.

A single and an EP followed shortly after before their one and only LP was released in 1965. The album included 10 original songs and is sung in Spanish in its entirety. The styles are quite varied. Vocal harmonies rerminiscent of The Beatles, Rhythm & Blues, Merseybeat, and even a blues are to be found.

"La Respuesta" is quite a fun track and one of my favourites; "En Tu Corazon" is the one that cries to be played over and over again. The vocal harmonies on this one are pure Nebbia!

The album was a commercial flop, and most band members decided to move back to Rosario. Litto, on the other hand, convinced Ciro to stay because he believed it was still possible. He was absolutely spot on, given that "Los Gatos" were less than 2 years ahead.

The album was re-issued in 2017, after more than 2000 original Music Hall master tapes (thought to have been lost) were recovered by the National Institute of Music (Instituto Nacional de la Musica, INAMU).

This copy, I believe, is a second press from a couple of years later. It could have been a move by Music Hall to cash in on Los Gatos' success at RCA.
