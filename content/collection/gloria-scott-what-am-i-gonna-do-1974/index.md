Casablanca – NB 9002 / 1974 / US

I came about this record about 7 years ago. I just looked at the cover and said to myself "I better like this album because the cover is stunning!".

Wow, what a record. Gloria Scott looks absolutely gorgeous in that portrait and the chosen colours could not be any better.

Produced by @barrywhitemusic with help from Gene Page, for the arrangements, and Tom Brock for the songwriting – What Am I Gonna Do was Gloria Scott's first and only full-length studio release. The album is quite rare and seldom-seen. It's been re-issued a few times in Japan as part of the "Free Soul Collection".

The opening track "What Am I Gonna Do" starts as a ballad but quickly changes into that Love Unlimited style that White and Page are so well-known for. "That's What You Say (Everytime You're Near Me)" is another classic with a great disco groove.

Without a doubt, "(A Case Of) Too Much Lovemakin'" has to be one of Barry White's best productions – ever. It's got that Love Unlimited sound imprinted all over it, but still sounds different. Scott's delivery is full of heart and soul. Wait until the percussion kicks in at ~1:20! And the strings at 2:20. This is one of those tracks that you have to listen several times in a row (I certainly did that this morning!).
