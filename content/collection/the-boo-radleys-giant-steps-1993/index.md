The Boo Radleys - Giant Steps
Creation Records - CRELP 149 / 1993 / UK

We continue with Creation albums released in 1993. This time, we have The Boo Radley's masterpiece "Giant Steps"; an album that was voted "Album of The Year" by NME and Select magazine.

Unlike with "Everything's Alright Forever", this time they decided to self-produce the album and threw psychedelia, dub, shoegaze, jazz, ambient, wonderfully crafted 60's pop, and everything in between. Just listen to "Butterfly McQueen" – how many genres are in a nearly 4-minute long song?

It includes the classic "Lazarus", but I'd like you to pay special attention to "Take The Time Around" – that's the kind of music I associate with Creation Records. Instant classic!
