Bobbi Humphrey - Blacks and Blues
Blue Note – BN-LA142-G / 1974 / US

Another classic when it comes to Mizell brothers productions. Released in 1974 and with a beautiful and iconic cover.

The Mizell brothers definitely had a thing with opening albums with special effects. This time, we hear wind as the intro to "Chicago, Damn". Lovely groove and beautiful vocal harmonies. Definitely a song that could be in any Mizell brothers' Donald Byrd album. All you need to do is replace the flute with a trumpet and you're all set.

"Harlem River Drive" is an instant classic, and it's probably the song that most people will be familiar with. To me, the highlight of the album is "Just a Love Child". Bobbi doesn't have the best voice, but the sweetness in her delivery is adorable. And the harmonies! I love those harmonies.

The groove on "Jasper Country Man" comes from Edwin Starr's "Easin' In" from the "Hell Up In Harlem" soundtrack, released in 1973.

If you are into "Sky High Productions", you must get this one. It's essential.
